## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the backbone of efficient programming. Mastering these concepts will not only enhance your problem-solving skills but also prepare you for technical interviews and real-world coding challenges.

## Daily Learning

Consistent learning is key to success. Here's what you can expect:

- **Structured Lessons**: Follow a structured path to learn different data structures and algorithms.
- **Conceptual Clarity**: Deep dive into concepts to build a strong foundation.
- **Hands-on Examples**: Practice with examples to solidify your understanding.

## Daily Practice

Practice is crucial for mastery. Engage in:

- **Coding Exercises**: Solve a variety of problems to apply what you've learned.
- **LeetCode Challenges**: Tackle problems from LeetCode to test your skills.
